# GLM-5.3-Flash NVFP4 + DFlash2 on 2x NVIDIA DGX Spark

[zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash) (320B total / 18B active MoE) served by vLLM at **tensor-parallel 2 across two DGX Spark** (GB10/SM121), **262,144-token context**, fp8 KV, DFlash2 speculative drafter.

**Current recipe: [CURRENT.md](CURRENT.md).** Read that first, it is the one configuration this repo ships, and it wins over anything below that disagrees.

One launcher: [`launch-glm53-vllm-tp2-dflash2.sh`](launch-glm53-vllm-tp2-dflash2.sh), **worker Spark4 (rank 1) FIRST, then head Reddie (rank 0)**, which serves :8000.

Weights: [RedHatAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/RedHatAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4) (compressed-tensors) at `/var/tmp/models/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4-redhat`, ModelOpt and abliterated NVFP4 quants corrupt tokens on this stack and the launcher refuses them.

Everything else here is reference: the bring-up log, the day-0 bug receipts, the benchmark history, and the open problems.

## ⭐ Checkpoint: `RedHatAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4` is now the default (corruption fix)

ModelOpt-quantized NVFP4 builds of GLM-5.3-Flash (`LibertAIDAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4` and the abliterated variants) emit **intermittent corrupted token IDs** ([vLLM #54150](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/54150)). Nearly invisible in English, but when a corrupted token lands inside a tool-call block the parser desyncs and generation can spiral into a repetition lock.

We reproduced and fixed it on this exact cluster (Korean-Hangul probe, `temperature 0`, non-streaming, 3 passes):

| checkpoint | `quant_method` | U+FFFD count (3 runs) |
|---|---|---|
| ModelOpt NVFP4 (LibertAIDAI / keys-ablit) | `modelopt` | 4 / 9 / 8 |
| **[RedHatAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/RedHatAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4)** | **`compressed-tensors`** | **0 / 0 / 0** |

**Default checkpoint: `RedHatAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4`.** Ungated, same `Glm5NextForConditionalGeneration` arch, **drop-in** — no flag changes (`--moe-backend marlin`, DFlash2 `k=7`, fp8 KV all identical), just repoint the model path. Loads ~2x faster (11 large shards vs 120 small). Tradeoff: it also quantizes activations to 4-bit (W4A4) where the weight-only builds are W4A16, so expect a few points lower on hard reasoning — but the output is **correct**. Make sure the vision `chat_template_mm.jinja` is present in the weights dir or image requests 500.

Corruption first flagged by [@ajclark](https://github.com/ajclark) (issue #10). Uncensored (abliterated) builds remain available but carry the ModelOpt corruption until a compressed-tensors abliteration exists.

## Weights: censored or uncensored (drop-in)

Pick your weights: **same launcher, same recipe**, just point the model path at either. Both are NVFP4 and load identically.

(seven day-0 bugs deep — [docs/DEPLOY-REPORT.md](docs/DEPLOY-REPORT.md)), and the **first
working DFlash2 deployment of this model on GB10** ([docs/DFLASH2-SPECULATIVE-DECODING.md](docs/DFLASH2-SPECULATIVE-DECODING.md)).

---

## Quickstart

**1. Pull the images** (GHCR, public, anonymous — no build required):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/tonyd2wild/vllm-glm53-flash:sm121-v11-dflash2   # with DFlash2 (recommended)
docker pull ghcr.io/tonyd2wild/vllm-glm53-flash:sm121-v8            # base, fp8 KV, no drafter
```

They contain **only vLLM + our patches** — no model weights (those bind-mount at runtime).
No retag step: the launchers reference these `ghcr.io/tonyd2wild/…` tags directly. (Only the
`docker/` build chain uses local `radixark/…` stage tags, and those never leave the build.)

**2. Fetch the weights** to the same path on both nodes (or NFS-export from the head):
[RedHatAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/RedHatAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4) (default) →
`/var/tmp/models/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4-redhat`, this is the path the launcher checks
(`MODEL_HOST_PATH`); override with `MODEL_HOST_PATH=…` if you keep weights elsewhere. For
DFlash2, also fetch the drafter (2.2 GB) → `/var/tmp/models/GLM-5.3-Flash-DFlash2`.

**3. Install the SM121 top-k fix** on **both** nodes. Both published images still contain a
decode-time top-k kernel that hard-kills the engine on any decode past ~24K context on GB10
(the launcher bind-mounts the fix over it):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/patches
cp docker/sparse_attn_indexer_kpool_sm121.py ~/patches/sparse_attn_indexer_kpool.py
```

Why, and what the crash looks like: [docs/SM121-CRASH-FORENSICS](docs/SM121-CRASH-FORENSICS-2026-08-27.md).

**4. Edit the launcher for your fabric.** Set the IPs/paths at the top of
[`launch-glm53-vllm-tp2-dflash2.sh`](launch-glm53-vllm-tp2-dflash2.sh), **and the NCCL
interface names inside the `docker run` body** (`NCCL_IB_HCA`, `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME`,
`NCCL_IB_ADDR_RANGE`) — wrong NIC names fail silently. `ibdev2netdev` and `ip -br a` will
tell you what yours are.

Then launch — **pre-launch ritual on BOTH nodes, every time** (GB10 unified memory):

```bash
sync; echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches      # both nodes
./launch-glm53-vllm-tp2-dflash2.sh 1    # worker FIRST
sleep 25
./launch-glm53-vllm-tp2-dflash2.sh 0    # then head — serves :8000
```

Without the drafter, use [`launch-glm53-vllm-tp2.sh`](launch-glm53-vllm-tp2.sh) (v8 image,
MTP-4, ~21.8 tok/s) — same ritual.

**5. Smoke test.** Wait for readiness first (~15 min; the shard load dominates). Poll
`/health`, **never `/v1/models`** — that returns 200 even with a dead engine:

```bash
until curl -sf http://<head>:8000/health >/dev/null; do sleep 20; done
```

```bash
curl http://<head>:8000/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"glm-5.3-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"2+2=?"}],
       "max_tokens":40,"chat_template_kwargs":{"enable_thinking":false}}'
```

[docs/DEPLOY-REPORT.md](docs/DEPLOY-REPORT.md).

<details>
<summary><b>Build the images yourself instead</b> (only if you want to modify the patches)</summary>

The base is the public day-0 image:

```bash
docker pull vllm/vllm-openai:glm53-flash-arm64-cu130     # or -x86_64- for x86
cd docker
for i in $(seq 1 9); do
  docker build -f "Dockerfile.glm53-sm121-v$i" -t "ghcr.io/tonyd2wild/vllm-glm53-flash:sm121-v$i" . || break
done
docker save ghcr.io/tonyd2wild/vllm-glm53-flash:sm121-v8 | ssh <worker> docker load
```

The chain is mostly linear (v1→v3→v4→…→v9); **v2 is an optional NaN-debug branch off v1** that nothing else builds on. For DFlash2, build
[`overlay-dflash2/`](overlay-dflash2/) on top of v8 afterwards.

> **Resolved.** The `FROM` lines of v2–v6 once referenced the original ad-hoc tag names
> (`sm121-nope-mla`, `sm121-fi618`, `sm121-fi618-nccl`, `sm121-final`) rather than
> `sm121-v1…v5`, so the loop above did not work. [#5](../../pull/5) (thanks @ozskywalker)
> normalized the chain to v-numbered tags and added `docker/build.sh`; no manual retagging
> between stages is needed.

Published image digests, so you can tell whether a local build differs:
`sm121-v8` → `sha256:d77d375c742fc54f436dec5108b440f58f021bc6600052bf0e8fe5840357e78f` ·
`sm121-v11-dflash2` → `sha256:4def0ef644cb2e9814136dcffd5e385e21bc594f48f3b292234051904abe85a6`

Both tags predate `overlay-dflash2/patch_prefix_cache_draft_group.py`, so a pull of
`sm121-v11-dflash2` still has the zero-hit coordinator; rebuild the overlay for the fix.

## Results (TP2, 2026-08-28)

**DFlash2 + fp8 KV — the shipped configuration.** All measured on our own hardware; the
harness is [`probes/bench_c1c6.py`](probes/bench_c1c6.py), run as:
`python3 probes/bench_c1c6.py --url http://<head>:8000 --rounds 2 --max-tokens 400`

| | value |
|---|---|
| Single-stream decode, code prompt, warm | **46.9 tok/s** at 74.1 % draft acceptance |
| Single-stream decode, structured output | **54–61 tok/s** (temp 0, 3 runs) |
| KV pool | **678,661 tokens** @ 262K context at the shipped 6 GiB pin (PR #16; 581,040 under profiler sizing before it, see the ceiling section) |
| Context | 262,144 |
| KV cost of the drafter | **zero** — it slot-shares the MLA tensors |
| Boot | ~15 min (shard load dominates) |

Concurrency sweep — 2 waves/level, 400-token generations, mixed code+prose, **zero failures**:

| | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | C6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| aggregate tok/s | 35.1 | 41.6 | 40.6 | 47.5 | **56.2** | 47.7 |
| per-stream tok/s | 35.1 | 23.2 | 17.3 | 15.3 | 17.5 | 13.3 |
| accepted ÷ drafted | 0.53 | 0.45 | 0.42 | 0.40 | 0.51 | 0.40 |

**The progression**, same fleet, same prompt style:

| config | decode | note |
|---|---|---|
| bf16, no speculation | 14.3 tok/s | |
| fp8 KV + MTP-4 | 21.8 tok/s | previous flagship |
| **fp8 KV + DFlash2** | **46.9 tok/s** | **2.15x** — this repo |
| fp8 KV + DFlash2 at TP4 | 68.5 tok/s | four nodes, 1M context — [sibling repo](https://github.com/tonyd2wild/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4-1M-KV-4x-DGX-Spark) |

Throughput tracks how *predictable* the output is, not just the config: structured/list/
tool-argument output drafts at ~0.9 acceptance, freeform prose nearer 0.33. Agentic traffic
lives in the high-acceptance zone. Detail and how to read these:

The original 2026-08-28 finding, kept because the mechanism still matters:

**Let vLLM's profiler size the pool. Do not pin `--kv-cache-memory`.**

That was the lesson at the time, and it cost us a night of boots to learn. When you pass
`--kv-cache-memory`, vLLM still runs the profile pass but **never subtracts the measured
activation peak** (`gpu_worker.py:475-495`) — it hands you exactly the number you asked
for and `--gpu-memory-utilization` becomes dead. Allocation succeeds, warmup succeeds, a
short generation succeeds, and then the first long prompt has nowhere to put its
activations and the engine dies. We reproduced that failure at four different pins.

Profiler-sized figures, all at `--max-model-len 262144` so they are comparable:

| config | KV pool | verified |
|---|---|---|
| **DFlash2 + fp8 KV** | **581,040 tokens** | serving; survived a 28,818-token prompt with the engine healthy after |
| **No drafter, fp8 KV** | **965,166 tokens** | allocated and booted; long-prompt survival not yet confirmed |

**The DFlash2 drafter costs ~4.8 GiB of KV headroom** — far more than its 2.2 GiB of
weights — which is a real trade nobody had priced: roughly **+91 % decode speed for −40 %
pool**. Choose per workload.

Three traps worth knowing before you tune this yourself:

- **The reported pool inflates with context.** `GPU KV cache size` is
  `int(max_concurrency × max_model_len)` (`kv_cache_utils.py:2264`), so raising
  `--max-model-len` raises the headline number without adding a byte of memory. Only
  `blocks × block_size`, or bytes/token, compares honestly across configs — and it is why
  pool figures published at 900K or 1M context are not comparable to figures at 262K.
- **`Available KV cache memory` is logged by rank 0 only, but the pool is built from the
  minimum across ranks** (`kv_cache_utils.py:2554`). One of our boots logged 6.25 GiB and
  bound 2.29 GiB. Read that line on **every** rank before trusting it.
- **The TP worker rank profiles 4–5 GiB less KV headroom than the head**, reproducibly, on
  both of our node pairs, independent of the drafter, of NFS, and of which physical machine
  is which. That asymmetry caps the pool and we have not explained it; it looks like an
  upstream vLLM question rather than a configuration error.

Operational note: on these 121 GiB unified-memory nodes, `vm.swappiness=0` is mandatory
and **does not survive a reboot**. With swap active the kernel pages vLLM out mid-load and
triggers a UVM driver livelock — one worker thread spinning at 100 %+ CPU, `UVM GPU` kthread
hot, GPU reporting high utilization at idle wattage, shard loading frozen at a reproducible
point. It does not recover on its own.

> A previous revision of this section published a 727,583-token figure at a 7 GiB pin as
> the usable ceiling. That configuration is **unsafe** (pinned, so no activation headroom),
> and no log of that measurement survived — it was quoted from a terminal session rather
> than a captured file. It has been withdrawn rather than restated.

### Tuning notes

- **`temperature: 0` is free throughput** (+13–21 %). vLLM's rejection sampler does an exact
  top-1 match at temp 0 but a probabilistic ratio test above it — and since the draft method is
  greedy, the draft probability is pinned to 1, making the T>0 test strictly harder.
- **`enable_thinking: false` is also the faster setting** (+8 % acceptance) — reasoning traces
  are higher-entropy and draft worse. Caveat: with thinking off GLM emits untagged
  reasoning-prose into `content`, which some agent harnesses mis-parse; see the deploy report.
- **K=7 is the default, but it is a workload choice, it was swept.** Conditional per-position
  acceptance is nearly flat (0.93/0.89/0.84/0.81/0.79/0.59/0.94), so the last position still
  earns; the drafter's `block_size: 8` caps K at 7 anyway, and a lower K gives a prettier
  *ratio* and worse throughput on a single stream. **But the sweep on 2026-09-02
  ([docs/TP2-SPEC-DEPTH-AND-KV-2026-09-02.md](docs/TP2-SPEC-DEPTH-AND-KV-2026-09-02.md),
  "Speculative depth: k=7 below C4, k=5 above it") found it inverts under concurrency**, 
  k=5 beats k=7 by +29.9% at C4 and +18.3% at C6, while losing on every single-stream prompt.
  That doc's result, quoted: "`num_speculative_tokens` is a **workload choice, not a
  default.** It inverts at C4… **The default stays k=7** (single-user and low-concurrency is
  the common case, and it is what the README's headline figures use). Serving deep
  concurrency should set k=5, or better, use a schedule with the crossover at C4:
  `"num_speculative_tokens_per_batch_size": [[1,3,7],[4,512,5]]`"
  A second independent pair (#21, 2026-09-16) re-measured after the prefix-cache repair and found the
  acceptance regime had moved (per-position ~100/97/96/91/90%, mean 4.75/5): k=7 beat k=5 by +19% on
  structured single-stream, was flat on prose, and lost 9% at C6. Same conclusion from the other
  direction: k is a workload choice, and the crossover sits around C4-C6.
- **Prefix cache now hits with DFlash2** once the overlay includes `patch_prefix_cache_draft_group.py` (#13). Agent sessions stop re-prefilling the whole conversation each turn: repeated 262K prompt, 0.986 hit rate, warm TTFT 3 s vs 192 s cold. See [PREFIX-CACHE-DFLASH2-SM121](docs/PREFIX-CACHE-DFLASH2-SM121.md).

---

- **Multi-user long context: keep `--max-num-seqs 1` until #14 is closed.** Two concurrent
  ~114K-token requests collapse decode to ~2 tok/s each on some TP2 pairs (#14, reproduced on
  a 4 GiB / 414K-token KV pin in #19, so it is not KV-pool exhaustion). The leading
  explanation is the DSA indexer: no varlen path off SM100, so each draft token costs one
  full-context indexer row per sequence. A lower k shrinks exactly that cost, which is the
  other reason long-context agent traffic wants k below 7. Single-user long context and
  multi-user short prompts are unaffected.
- **Pin the drafter revision.** `incoai/GLM-5.3-Flash-DFlash2` has shipped different bytes
  under the same tag (#7: `model.safetensors` sha256 `b33c0347...` vs `8931dc52...`, pulled
  days apart). Two pairs on the same recipe measured 0.73 acceptance and one measured 0.35,
  with that hash mismatch sitting right there. If acceptance is far below the numbers in
  [Results](#results-tp2-2026-08-28), re-pull the drafter by explicit revision before
  touching anything in the image chain, and run the count-to-100 probe at temperature 0
  (`Count from 1 to 100. Output only the numbers, one per line, nothing else.`): a healthy
  engine returns ~0.9 acceptance on it regardless of workload.

## Status: work in progress

This repo is an active bring-up log, not a finished product. Everything published here is
measured on our own hardware and dated — **if a number is not in a dated table, treat it as
unverified.**

| | state |
|---|---|
| **DFlash2 + fp8 KV, TP2** | ✅ **Proven.** Benchmarked C1–C6, zero failures. This is the config to copy. |
| **DFlash2 + fp8 KV, TP4 / 1M ctx** | ✅ Serving — 68.5 tok/s, 2,622,494-token pool. See the sibling repo. |
| **DFlash2 + NVFP4 KV, TP2** | ⚠️ **Partial.** Serves and drafts (35.9 tok/s, 0.563 acceptance, 334K pool), but prompts long enough to need chunked prefill (>~3K tokens) kill the rank-0 worker. Root cause open; the standalone drafter KV path is the suspect. [Details](docs/DFLASH2-SPECULATIVE-DECODING.md). |
| **InstantTensor fast load** | ⚠️ Experimental — 15x faster loads, unstable multi-node. See below. |

## Why this needs a patched image

The vLLM PR authors' day-0 image (`vllm/vllm-openai:glm53-flash-arm64-cu130`) works on B200.
On GB10/SM121 it fails five separate ways. Our derivative (`docker/Dockerfile.glm53-sm121*`,
applied in order) fixes those five, then adds a sixth patch that unlocks fp8 KV:

1. **NoPE MLA vs the SM12x sparse backend** — the only stock capability-12 sparse-attention
   backend requires the packed `fp8_ds_mla` layout, which hardcodes DeepSeek's `pe_dim=64`.
   GLM-5.3 is NoPE (`qk_rope_head_dim=0`) → assert death in warmup. Fix: extend vLLM's SM90
   NoPE sparse-MLA backend to SM121 with the FA2 path — probed on-GPU with the model's real
   shape before trusting it (`probes/probe_sm121_nope_mla.py`).
2. **FlashInfer 0.6.17 FA2 MLA NaN** — the FA2 scheduler produces NaN for 64–256-row batches
   on SM121 (bisect: `probes/probe_fa2_bisect.py`), and normal prompts land exactly there.
   Fix: FlashInfer **0.6.18 nightly**.
3. **The nightly's dependency sabotage** — it silently downgrades `nvidia-nccl-cu13` to 2.29.7
   (NCCL "internal error" on the Spark IB fabric; re-pin **2.30.7**) and skews
   `nvidia-cutlass-dsl` to a mixed 4.7.0/4.6.2 state (CuTeDSL warmup ICE; re-pin **4.6.2**).
   Audit transitive pins after ANY pip install in these images.
4. **PDL on unvalidated silicon** — vLLM enables Programmatic Dependent Launch for capability
   ≥ 9, including SM121, in the Triton kernels carrying KDA recurrent state. Gated off on SM12x.
5. **Indexer uninitialized top-k** — the kpool top-k destination was `torch.empty` and the
   kernels only guarantee the first `min(k, valid)` entries; short rows carried garbage pool
   ids → bogus token indices → NaN lottery. Fix: init to `-1` + clamp (`docker/patch_v7.py`).
6. **fp8 KV cache unlock** (v8, `docker/patch_v8_fp8.py`) — see below.

Two serve-flag landmines, no code needed:

- **`--block-size 2304`** — vLLM's hybrid block aligner picks a size whose kpool storage tiles
  by 32, but DeepGEMM's arch-12 fp8 paged-MQA accepts only 64-entry pool pages. 2304 is a
  multiple of kpool·64 and of the MLA 128 alignment.
- **`--gpu-memory-utilization 0.85`** — 0.78–0.80 starve the KV cache at 131K+.

### fp8 KV cache on GB10: a two-line fix (and, as far as we can tell, a first)

FlashInfer gates fp8 MLA KV to SM90, and naively relaxing the gate fails with CUDA "invalid
argument" (`probes/probe_fa2_fp8.py`). The real cause (`docker/patch_v8_fp8.py`): the fa2 fp8
branch **forces `CTA_TILE_KV=32`, a Hopper 228KB-smem assumption**. On GB10's ~101KB opt-in max
that over-requests shared memory (117,312 B > 101,376 B) at `cudaFuncSetAttribute`, before the
kernel ever launches. **Capping the tile instead of forcing it** (fp8 keeps TKV=16 on
100KB-class devices — 91,680 B, fits) makes fp8 KV work: verified on-GPU, rel-err ~0.005 vs an
fp32 reference, then end-to-end in production.

As far as we can tell this is the first fp8 KV cache for a NoPE-MLA model on any consumer
Blackwell part. Upstream-ready issue drafts with receipts:
`docs/issue-flashinfer-fp8-mla-sm121.md`, `docs/issue-vllm-nope-fp8-ds-mla.md`.

## Hard-won operational rules

- **Tear down BOTH ranks before relaunching either.** A rank that rendezvouses with a dying one
  hangs or dies confusingly.
- **`grep '^IMAGE' launch-*.sh` on BOTH nodes before every launch.** Two "mystery" garbage boots
  were a silent image-version mismatch between ranks. Copy whole files between nodes; never
  `sed` over ssh.
- **Capture `docker logs` before `docker rm -f`.**
- **Probe `/health` for liveness, never `/v1/models`** — the latter returns 200 from config alone, with a dead engine behind it.
- **Two consecutive unexplained deaths = stop and diagnose.** Never crash-loop.
- **Swap on with `vm.swappiness=0`** — not off. Fully disabled, the worker dies during MoE
  marlin repack with no valve; at default swappiness the kernel pages vLLM out mid-load and
  triggers a UVM driver livelock that freezes the shard loader.
- `max_tokens` includes reasoning tokens when thinking is on; disable per-request with

- **Do not benchmark on a fresh boot; warm the batch shapes first (#21).** The first
  concurrent burst after a cold start can trigger a TileLang JIT compile mid-batch
  (`mhc_pre_big_fuse_with_norm_tilelang` in the log at the exact moment of the burst); the
  worker RPC stalls cross-rank and the engine dies with `TimeoutError: RPC call to
  sample_tokens timed out` then `EngineDeadError`. Send a few small concurrent requests
  (4 x 32-token generations) before any real load. `fleet_watchdog.sh` recovers the pair, but
  the bench you were running is gone.

**Debugging kit** (reusable for any day-0 model on new silicon): `probes/probe_sm121_nope_mla.py`
(probe a kernel with your real geometry before patching arch gates) · `probes/probe_fa2_bisect.py`
(NaN bisect over batch shapes) · `probes/probe_mhc.py` (A/B a Triton kernel vs its torch
reference) · `probes/gb10_alloc_probe.py` (map the allocation wall) · `probes/bench_c1c6.py`.
The deploy report also describes the env-gated forward-hook NaN localizer (`GLM53_NAN_DEBUG=1`)
that names the first module emitting non-finite values.

### Fast loading: InstantTensor (experimental)

The v9 image adds the InstantTensor direct-I/O loader (`--load-format instanttensor`): loads
drop from ~10 minutes to 40–100 seconds and the page cache stays empty. **But in all four of
our v9 TP2 boots a rank died silently ~1 minute after loading** (exit code None, nothing in
dmesg) at every KV budget — so the shipped launchers do not enable it and the stable image
remains v8. This matches the known multi-node instability class for direct-IO loaders on Spark
(eugr/spark-vllm-docker#29). Because direct I/O never fills the page cache it also defeats the
first layer of the GB10 KV-allocation wall — full story in
[docs/GB10-KV-MEMORY-LADDER.md](docs/GB10-KV-MEMORY-LADDER.md). Credit: jack6464 (NVIDIA forum).

### vLLM v0.28.0 status (checked 2026-08-27)

**Not viable for GLM-5.3 yet**: the `glm5_next` architecture is not in the v0.28.0 release
(vllm-project/vllm#53906 still unmerged at check time) and no rebased day-0 image exists. The
day-0 image used here is itself a main-branch dev snapshot (`0.1.dev20051`) cut near the 0.28
branch point — this stack already runs 0.28-era engine code *plus* the GLM support 0.28 lacks.
Porting is mechanical when it opens: the patches are guarded string-replacements that apply or
refuse loudly.
