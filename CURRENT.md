## Topology

GLM-5.3-Flash NVFP4 + DFlash2, **tensor-parallel 2 across two DGX Spark (GB10/SM121) nodes**,
**262,144-token context**.

| rank | host | IP | role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Spark4 | `192.168.192.4` | worker (`--headless`), **launch FIRST** |
| **0** | Reddie | `192.168.192.2` | head, serves the OpenAI API on **:8000** |

Rendezvous: master addr `192.168.192.2`, master port `29521`, `--nnodes 2`,
`--distributed-executor-backend mp`.

**1M-context TP2 variants starved the KV pool and crashed the fleet three times on
2026-09-01. 262K is the current context.** Do not raise `--max-model-len` on TP2.

## The one launcher

```bash
sync; echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches      # BOTH nodes, every launch
./launch-glm53-vllm-tp2-dflash2.sh 1    # Spark4, rank 1, worker, FIRST
sleep 25
./launch-glm53-vllm-tp2-dflash2.sh 0    # Reddie, rank 0, head, serves :8000
```

[`launch-glm53-vllm-tp2-dflash2.sh`](launch-glm53-vllm-tp2-dflash2.sh) is the only launcher
for this recipe. The drop-caches step is not optional on these unified-memory nodes.

Readiness takes ~15 minutes (shard load dominates). Poll `/health`, never `/v1/models`, 
the latter returns 200 from config alone with a dead engine behind it.

## Image

```
ghcr.io/tonyd2wild/vllm-glm53-flash:sm121-v11-dflash2
```

Public, anonymous pull, on **both** nodes. Also required on both nodes before launch:
`cp docker/sparse_attn_indexer_kpool_sm121.py ~/patches/sparse_attn_indexer_kpool.py`
(the SM121 top-k fix the launcher bind-mounts over the image's copy).

**The published `sm121-v11-dflash2` tag was built 2026-08-28 and does not carry the #18
prefix-cache repair.** With it, agent sessions re-prefill the whole conversation every turn.
Two ways to get the repair without waiting for a new tag: rebuild the overlay
(`overlay-dflash2/Dockerfile`), or bind-mount the patched `kv_cache_coordinator.py` onto v11
the way the launcher already overlays the kpool file. Both are written up in
[docs/PREFIX-CACHE-DFLASH2-SM121.md](docs/PREFIX-CACHE-DFLASH2-SM121.md).

## Weights

```
/var/tmp/models/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4-redhat
```

This is the path the launcher checks (`MODEL_HOST_PATH`), on both nodes.
[RedHatAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/RedHatAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4),
compressed-tensors.

**ModelOpt and abliterated NVFP4 quants corrupt tokens on this stack; the launcher refuses
them.** The guard reads `quantization_config.quant_method` from `config.json` and exits 5 on
`modelopt` unless `ALLOW_MODELOPT=1` (vLLM
[#54150](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/54150)).

The drafter, also on both nodes: `/var/tmp/models/GLM-5.3-Flash-DFlash2` (2.2 GB,
[incoai/GLM-5.3-Flash-DFlash2](https://huggingface.co/incoai/GLM-5.3-Flash-DFlash2)).

### KV **is** pinned at 6 GiB

This reverses earlier README guidance ("let the profiler size the pool, do not pin
`--kv-cache-memory`"). The shipped launcher pins **6442450944 bytes**. Rationale and
measurement: [`docs/TP2-SPEC-DEPTH-AND-KV-2026-09-02.md`](docs/TP2-SPEC-DEPTH-AND-KV-2026-09-02.md),
section "KV 3 -> 6 GiB: unconditional", 6 preemptions under load at 3 GiB, **0 at 6 GiB**,
with the pool going **310,292 -> 678,661 tokens**. Preemption under load costs more than any
tok/s figure, and the memory is available. Adopted as the default in
[#16](https://github.com/tonyd2wild/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4-DFlash2-2x-DGX-Spark/pull/16).

Measured KV pool at the shipped pin: **678,661 tokens**.

### `--enforce-eager` stays on for TP2

CUDA graphs are the **TP4 sibling repo's lane**, not this one. Same doc, section "CUDA graphs
do NOT transfer from TP4": `cudagraph_mode: FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` is a clear win at TP4
(503 -> 530 tok/s aggregate) and **flat** at TP2, C1 +4.1%, C2 −4.6%, C4 +1.1%, C6 −1.7%,
mean ≈ −0.3%. TP2 keeps `--enforce-eager`.

## Expected numbers

All from [`docs/TP2-SPEC-DEPTH-AND-KV-2026-09-02.md`](docs/TP2-SPEC-DEPTH-AND-KV-2026-09-02.md),
section "Speculative depth: k=7 below C4, k=5 above it", measured 2026-09-02, RedHatAI
compressed-tensors checkpoint, DFlash2, temperature 0, 8-prompt set, median of 3, each arm
under its own `VLLM_CACHE_ROOT`.

Shipped config (k=7), aggregate by concurrency:

| C | tok/s |
|---|---|
| 1 | 44.75 |
| 2 | 68.18 |
| 4 | 64.83 |
| 6 | 84.82 |

Shipped config (k=7), single stream by prompt:

| prompt | tok/s |
|---|---|
| count-to-100 | 67.12 |
| code | 47.33 |
| tooluse | 48.72 |
| sql | 41.19 |
| json | 46.73 |
| math | 41.26 |

Real prompts, this exact recipe run verbatim on Reddie + Spark4 on 2026-09-01, isolated, temperature 0
(40-prompt battery, 8 categories, three runs; source: the EXL3 comparison repo,
https://github.com/tonyd2wild/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-on-2x-NVIDIA-DGX-Spark/blob/main/results/summary.md):

| | tok/s or s |
|---|---|
| prose decode, single stream | 18.8 (range 18.8 to 19.8) |
| code decode, single stream | 52.2 (range 48.3 to 57.7) |
| mixed load, four real prompts in flight | 31.4 tok/s aggregate, first token 1.97 s |
| first token, fresh 1.6K prompt, c1 / c6 | 1.29 s / 4.53 s |
| cold prefill, fresh 211K prompt | 2,763 tok/s |
| counting prompt, single stream (ceiling only) | 64.0 |

The 46.9 tok/s in the README (2026-08-28, `probes/bench_c1c6.py`, code prompt) and the 47.33 above
(2026-09-02 doc) are the same measurement on different days and harnesses; quote either with its date.

`num_speculative_tokens` is a workload choice, not a default: the same section measures k=5
beating k=7 by +29.9% at C4 and +18.3% at C6, while losing on every single-stream prompt.
Deep-concurrency serving should set k=5, or use the schedule with the crossover at C4:
`"num_speculative_tokens_per_batch_size": [[1,3,7],[4,512,5]]`. **The default stays k=7.**

## How we quote numbers

- **Decode** is quoted from **real prompts**, prose and code, because acceptance, and
  therefore throughput, is workload-bound. A single decode number without the prompt mix is
  not comparable to anything.
- **The counting prompt** (count-to-100 and friends) is quoted only as a **labeled
  draft-acceptance ceiling**. It is the most predictable text the drafter will ever see; it is
  not a decode figure and must never be presented as the headline.
- **Prefill** is quoted **cold only**. First inference JIT-compiles kernels, so a warm prefill
  number measures the cache, not the stack.

## Four Sparks?

Use the sibling repo:
**[GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4-1M-KV-4x-DGX-Spark](https://github.com/tonyd2wild/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4-1M-KV-4x-DGX-Spark)**
, TP4, the model-native 1M context, and the lane where CUDA graphs pay.
